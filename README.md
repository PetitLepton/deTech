This repository contains the material for the workshop “Data Analysis and Information Sharing” at the [deTech conference](https://detechconf.com) in Penang, Malaysia.

The objective of the workshop is to give basic techniques for sharing information extracted from data analysis performed with the Python programming language. The emphasis is particularly made on methods and techniques that can be automated.
> The idea behind automation is the opportunity to deploy a system that would allow data analysts to “easily” share information inside a team or a company.
 
Beyond the data analysis, the workshop aims at giving good practices on shaping elements like tables and charts.

There are two ways to use the material:
- clone the project and install the virtual environment through [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html);
